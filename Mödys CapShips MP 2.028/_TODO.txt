VERY IMPORTANT:
tryin to fix flhook plugin <- [done by MoD :P]
fix some more ship infocards and/or create new ones (especially the xl_trains & transporters)
server operator npcs script fixes (due to MoD's crazy spawn overhaul^^ the sections @ the xmls must be fixed) <- done
Sigma-? ;) <- RandomJumps implemented ... now someone needs to create the system :D <- done
Fix old rep values at the /restart files

NOT VERY IMPORTANT:
get a good webspace & server ^^

faction based tractor colors <- colors = done, loadouts = up next ver (hopefully^^) + maybe faction tokens @ npcs? (but i think that nobody will give a fuck about that^^)

german||english resource.dll <- need to figure out the right impl.tation

missions against nomads/8472s <- up next versions (hopefully^^) will take a while^^, faction is now implemented

dynamic lighting <- must be redone [Addition by MoD: it will fail cuz of M$ and dx8 >_<]

IDEAS:
raid systems
pvp systems <- done, but still a little bit boring
fl hook update <- done to latest flhook classic & svn + kosa plugins
fix bloom script <- done by ***M.o.D.***
custom jumptunnels between certain areas, like greenish @ RH  & yellow/orange @ KU & red@BR <- still in testing
