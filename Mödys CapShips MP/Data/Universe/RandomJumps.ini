; Use the new file DATA\UNIVERSE\RandomJumps.ini to associate an object with
; its destinations.  NB: the original destination must be included if it is to
; be used.  The format is:

	; [RandomJump]
	; object = OBJECT 		; the jump [Object]
	; goto = SYSTEM, OBJECT [,COUNT]	; destination system and object
	; goto = SYSTEM, OBJECT [,COUNT]	; and so on

; Each destination has an equal probability of being chosen, but COUNT can be
; used to duplicate each entry.  For example:

	; [RandomJump]
	; object = Li01_to_Li02		; New York to California Jump Gate
	; goto = Li02, Li02_to_Li01, 3	; California, original jump
	; goto = Li03, Li03_to_Li01, 2	; Colorado
	; goto = Li04, Li04_to_Li01, 1	; Texas

; which is exactly equivalent to:

	; [RandomJump]
	; object = Li01_to_Li02		; New York to California Jump Gate
	; goto = Li02, Li02_to_Li01	; California, original jump
	; goto = Li02, Li02_to_Li01	; California, original jump
	; goto = Li02, Li02_to_Li01	; California, original jump
	; goto = Li03, Li03_to_Li01	; Colorado
	; goto = Li03, Li03_to_Li01	; Colorado
	; goto = Li04, Li04_to_Li01	; Texas

; and means California will be chosen half the time (3/6), Colorado a third of
; the time (2/6) and Texas a sixth of the time (1/6).  A COUNT less than one
; will ignore that destination.

[RandomJump]
object = Bw06_to_BW11_hole			; Sigma-17 to Sigma-? (anomaly of time :) )
goto = BW11, BW11_to_Bw06_hole, 1	; Sigma-? (chance of 1/4)
goto = Bw06, Bw06_to_BW11_hole, 3	, Sigma-17 again ;)
